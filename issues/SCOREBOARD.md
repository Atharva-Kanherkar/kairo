# Reproduction scoreboard

Live captures, 2026-08-12. "Repro" = confirmed with our own recorded wire
bytes on the stated version. Each folder has a writeup + transcripts.

| # | Failure | Tool / version | Cited issue | Result |
|---|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| 001 | tool call arrives but `stop_reason`=`end_turn`; phantom empty block | LiteLLM 1.82.0 | [litellm#25390](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/25390) | ✅ repro on 1.82.0; fixed (silently) on 1.96.2 |
| 001 | empty `tool_use.input` (the cited symptom) | LiteLLM 1.96.2 | litellm#25390/#29491 | ⬜ not repro on current (patched) |
| 002 | streaming `finish_reason`=`stop` not `tool_calls` | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Ollama | [litellm#35663](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/35663) | ✅ repro on CURRENT |
| 002 | `ollama/` route drops tool call entirely (→ empty msg / `reasoning_content`) | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Ollama | litellm#31911 family | ✅ repro on CURRENT (worse than cited) |
| 003 | tool arg containing `[DONE]` false-terminates stream | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Gemini | [litellm#31562](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/31562) | ⬜ not repro (Gemini sends args whole; needs token-streaming backend) |
| 004 | `thought_signature` dropped → 400 | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Gemini 3 | [ollama#14567](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/14567) | ⬜ not dropped by LiteLLM (it's an Ollama/CCR bug) |
| 004 | signature smuggled into tool-call **id** → 382-char id w/ `+ / =`, violates OpenAI+Anthropic id charset | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Gemini 3 | Switchyard#178 family | ✅ repro on CURRENT (new finding) |
| 004 | same on `/v1/responses`: 832-char `call_id` client must echo + phantom empty message item | LiteLLM 1.96.2 → Gemini 3 | — | ✅ repro on CURRENT (new finding) |

**Tally**: 5 defects confirmed on the wire (4 on current releases), 3
cited-symptoms not reproduced (patched or wrong tool), spanning 3 API dialects
(Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, Responses) and 2 backends. Two findings
(the id-smuggling in 004) are stronger than the tickets we started from.

Method note: negatives are kept, not deleted. "Cited bug already patched" is
itself data — it is why a permanent regression suite matters, and every capture
here becomes one whether it currently passes or fails.
